summary: "World Conflicts Analyzer is a near‑realtime map and natural‑language interface over ACLED’s conflict dataset, built by configuring Palantir Foundry pipelines to ingest, normalize, and geocode new events and exposing a question‑answering layer via AIP. <br><br> I focused on reliable ingestion/cleaning, geospatial joins, and prompt/context design to keep answers concise, location‑aware, and low on hallucinations. <br><br> Stack highlights: Palantir Foundry/AIP, ACLED data, geospatial processing, prompt/response tuning. <br><br> [view the demo](https://x.com/bricewduke/status/1823808695710425460)"
