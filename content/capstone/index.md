date: "2025-09-10"
summary: "Our capstone, sponsored by Everfox, builds two Linux utilities to make VSCode extensions manageable in air‑gapped networks.<br><br> The online “packager” reads a YAML config, resolves and downloads the latest versions of specified extensions, and produces a zip archive plus a signed manifest, logging to syslog for auditability. The offline “unpacker” runs inside the airgap, verifies signatures and checksums, and performs atomic installs to the user’s extensions directory with clear rollback semantics and syslog logs.<br><br>We’re emphasizing supply‑chain integrity, reproducible packaging, and operator‑friendly UX so the tooling can be automated across Everfox’s development environments.<br><br>Stack highlights: Linux (x86_64), YAML configs, syslog, cryptographic signing/verification.<br><br> [view the repo to track our progress](https://github.com/briceduke/utd-se4485-group-3)"
