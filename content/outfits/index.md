summary: "Outfits.bio is a web platform for sharing wardrobes and finding inspiration. I developed and operated a ~20,000‑line TypeScript codebase using Next.js and tRPC, implementing profiles, posts, follows, and activity feeds for hundreds of users.<br><br>The production system includes image upload/processing, caching, and CI/CD with monitoring and alerting to maintain performance and uptime under real traffic. The project gave me end‑to‑end ownership experience, from UI and API design to data modeling, observability, and incident response.<br><br>Stack highlights: TypeScript, Next.js, tRPC, Postgres, object storage, CI/CD.<br><br> [view my fork of the repo](https://github.com/briceduke/app)"
