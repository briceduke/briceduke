bio: "I became an engineer to build things that make people safer, more prosperous, and more free.  I am drawn to problems that matter in the real world, where software and systems raise capacity, cut risk, and shorten the distance between intent and outcome.  My work and ambitions center on five pillars of American strength: manufacturing, defense, finance, law, and space.
<br><br>
**Manufacturing** is national capability.  It’s the only way to turn ideas into machines, parts, and infrastructure.  When we can design and build at home, we control timelines, supply chains, and in effect, our destiny.  A strong manufacturing base underwrites everything else.
<br><br>
**Defense** preserves peace and protects lives.  A credible and reliable war machine lets people live freely, work creatively, and argue openly, and the surest path to one is readiness, fieldable technology, and principled conduct.
<br><br>
**Finance** is how we turn savings into progress.  By allocating capital, pricing risk, and widening participation, a healthy financial ecosystem powers new companies, new jobs, and the American Dream.  Building transparent and trustworthy infrastructure for this ecosystem is imperative.
<br><br>
The rule of **Law** is the operating system for a free society.  Separation of powers, judicial independence, and jury trials put the law, not a ruler, above everyone.  Technology should lower cost and complexity while strengthening due process.
<br><br>
**Space** expands what’s possible on Earth and safeguards humanity.  It sharpens engineering and science, extends communication, and opens a vast expanse of new resources. It strengthens the other four pillars by adding reach, resilience, and perspective.
<br><br>
I like being close to users and hardware, and value hands-on work, plain language, and accountability (if I help build it, I help operate it).  When it comes to technical matters, security, performance, and craftsmanship are *design constraints*.  I want to learn beyond the software I write, whether it's tools, shop practices, standards, electronics, or whatever the field demands.  I am aiming my energy toward work that will shorten timelines, improve reliability, reduce costs, mitigate risks, increase capacity, and protect lives.
<br><br>
If you’re building in manufacturing, defense, finance, law, or space and you care about shipping durable, real-world systems, I’d like to help.
